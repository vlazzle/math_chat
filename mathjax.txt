MathJax's TEX input jax implements:
- Nearly all plain TEX math-mode macros
- But not stretchable glue or rules, and no low-level box commands, and no \halign
- Some standard LATEX macros and environments
  (\frac, \sqrt[]{}, \mathbb, etc.)
- AMS symbols and AMS math environments
  (gather, split, align, etc.)
- Some extensions (e.g., \unicode)
