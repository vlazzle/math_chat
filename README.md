This is a chat server largely based on [Ryan Dahl's node_chat](http://github.com/ry/node_chat)

My changes so far:

- Middleware support, powered by [Connect](http://github.com/senchalabs/connect/)
- More streamlined static file serving
- gzip compression
- Support for client-side parsing of Latex expressions, powered by [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/)
- Slightly improved connection error handling
